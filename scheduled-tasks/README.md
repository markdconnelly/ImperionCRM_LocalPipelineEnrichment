# `scheduled-tasks/` — task files & polling registry

One **scheduled task per `(source, entity)`** (CLAUDE.md §1). Each task file here is **short**:
import the module, initialize context, call one `get` + one `post`. All orchestration lives in
the task file so the functions stay reusable by backfills and ad-hoc runs. Tasks are registered
with `Register-ImperionTask` and run under the gMSA / service identity, "whether logged on or
not".

## Task-file pattern

```powershell
# <area>/<entity>.task.ps1 — keep it this short.
Import-Module ImperionPipeline
Initialize-ImperionContext
# get -> post; the function does the heavy lifting, the task just composes + is scheduled.
Invoke-Imperion<Entity>Sync   # or:  Get-Imperion... | Set-Imperion...ToBronze
```

Registration (run once, elevated, under the service identity):

```powershell
Register-ImperionTask -Name 'Imperion m365 Mail' `
  -Command 'Import-Module ImperionPipeline; Initialize-ImperionContext; & "C:\...\scheduled-tasks\m365\mail.task.ps1"' `
  -Interval Hourly
```

## Status

Task files land as their `get`/`post` functions are built and tested (build order:
connect → get → post → task). Landed: `posture/service-principals`, `autotask/contracts`,
`autotask/tickets`, `telivy/assessments`, `darkwebid/compromises`, `docusign/envelopes`
(gated on the SecretStore secrets — see `docs/integrations/docusign.md`), `m365/users`,
`m365/devices`, `itglue/organizations`, `itglue/contacts`, `itglue/configurations`,
`itglue/export`, `azure/inventory` (per-entity get → post composition; management groups
stay with `Invoke-ImperionAzureInventorySync`), `azure/sentinel` (the Sentinel get →
multi-table router post, issue #97), `kqm/opportunities` (header #160 + won-quote detail
#161 chained; gated on the API key; verify live field names with `Get-ImperionKqmFieldName`
first — issue #98), and the m365
communications tasks `m365/mail`, `m365/teams-chat`, `m365/teams-meeting` (issue #100 —
double-gated: env-var config + migration 0065 prod apply; Teams reads additionally need
Microsoft's protected-API approval, see docs/integrations/m365-communications.md), and
the meta tasks `meta/social`, `meta/insights` (issue #126 — gated on
IMPERION_META_PAGE_ID + the SecretStore token + migration 0075 prod apply; registration
itself deferred to server bringup #102, see docs/integrations/meta.md), and
`m365/defender` (issue #138 — Defender XDR incidents + alerts, gated on migration 0076
prod apply; registration deferred to #102, see docs/integrations/defender-xdr.md), and
`m365/auth-methods` (issue #140 — per-user MFA registration, gated on migration 0077
prod apply; registration deferred to #102, see docs/integrations/entra-auth-methods.md),
and `m365/sharepoint-sites` (issue #137 — SharePoint site inventory, metadata only /
never file content, gated on migration 0078 prod apply; registration deferred to #102,
see docs/integrations/sharepoint-sites.md), and `m365/entra-groups` (issue #150, split
from #139 — Entra/M365 group inventory, migration 0079 applied; registration deferred to
#102, see docs/integrations/entra-groups.md), and `m365/entra-group-members` (issue #139 -
group membership edges reaching the silver contact via member_external_id, migration 0079
applied; registration deferred to #102, see docs/integrations/entra-groups.md), and
`easydmarc/domains` (issue #122 — domain/DMARC posture, double-gated on the EasyDMARC API
key + the proposed `easydmarc_domains` front-end bronze migration; registration deferred to
#102, see docs/integrations/easydmarc.md).
Still to land: `autotask/companies`, `autotask/contacts`, the remaining posture tasks,
and `kaseya/import`.
