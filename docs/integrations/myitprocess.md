# Integration — myITprocess: vCIO strategic roadmap / QBR recommendations

myITprocess is the **vCIO advisory layer** (issue #195, ADR-0018): strategic roadmap / QBR /
assessment recommendations (initiatives, alignment scores, recommendations) scoped to an
**account** (not a device). These feed account health and the QBR narrative. A **read-only**,
pull-only scheduled bulk pull lands into Postgres bronze (`myitprocess_recommendations`).
**Read-only throughout — the app never writes myITprocess.**

> **Schema is front-end-owned (system CLAUDE.md §1).** `myitprocess_recommendations` is defined by
> front-end migration **0119** (front-end #674), **SHIPPED + prod-applied** — schema gate CLEAR.
> This collector NEVER creates the table; it **fails loudly** if absent (ADR-0005). The remaining
> gate is the API key (below).

## Source & auth
| Source | API | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| myITprocess | myITprocess Reporting API (`https://reporting.live.myitprocess.com/public-api/v1`) — verified live, #297 | **`mitp-api-key` header** (URLs are NOT secret-bearing). Key Vault `conn-company-myitprocess` (cert SP) — the standardized credential-registry secret, read as a JSON blob and the `apiKey` field extracted (#292 → #299). KV-only; the legacy SecretStore `myitprocess-api-key` / KV `myITprocess-API-Key` are retired |

- **MSP-wide vendor credential** (ADR-0018 §2) — Imperion's own vCIO account, not per-client.
- **Read-only / pull-only** (no webhooks reach a home server — ADR-0001).
- **Paging:** `?page=N` from 1; the connect helper (`Invoke-ImperionMyItProcessRequest`) stops on a
  short page, hard-capped by `-MaxPages`. Throttling handled by the retry core.

## Entity & Postgres target (bronze)
| Entity | Source | Bronze table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recommendation | `myitprocess` | `myitprocess_recommendations` |

`myitprocess_recommendations` columns (front-end migration 0119, verified against prod):
`account_ref, assessment_name, recommendation_title, category, priority, status, target_date` + the
standard envelope (`tenant_id, source, external_id, collected_at, raw_payload, content_hash`).
`external_id` = the recommendation **id** (stable) → idempotent upsert.

## Flatten — straight to Postgres (IT Glue skipped)
**Borderline case (ADR-0018 §1, ADR-0006 §2 — the CRM/advisory exception).** myITprocess is
**strategic / account-scoped** data, not operational infrastructure, so it flattens **straight to
Postgres bronze and SKIPS the IT Glue hub** (same call as the KQM / DocuSign / EasyDMARC sources).
The account → client-tenant mapping is downstream silver (front-end); this bronze stamps the partner
tenant and preserves the raw account ref in `account_ref`.

## Downstream consumer (NOT done here)
Account-advisory rollups (alignment scores, open-recommendation counts) feed account health / QBR
narrative; "unprotected / stale-backup" counts from Datto BCDR roll up here too (ADR-0018 future
considerations). A dedicated silver `myitprocess` advisory concept is **a front-end call** (system
CLAUDE.md §11) — NOT implemented in this collector.

## Cadence
Daily (`scheduled-tasks/myitprocess/recommendations.task.ps1`). Roadmap / QBR / assessment
recommendations change slowly; stagger from the Datto tasks.

## Gates (Mark — block LIVE not BUILD)
1. **myITprocess API key** — enter it in **Settings → Credentials (My IT Process)**; the backend
   custodies it in Key Vault as `conn-company-myitprocess` (JSON blob; the LP resolver extracts
   `apiKey`, #299). Until then the resolver throws and the task logs + exits cleanly.
2. ~~Front-end `myitprocess_recommendations` bronze migration~~ — **SHIPPED + prod-applied**
   (migration 0119, #674).

## Verified vs still-assumed (#297)
**Verified live (2026-06-21, a direct GET returned HTTP 200):** base host
`https://reporting.live.myitprocess.com/public-api/v1`, auth header `mitp-api-key`, resource path
`/recommendations`, and the response wrapper `{ page, pageSize, totalCount, items }` — paging stops
on `totalCount` (server-page-size safe), short-page heuristic only as a no-`totalCount` fallback.
Corroborated by the Celerium MyITProcess-PowerShellWrapper + Kaseya Swagger.

**Still assumed** (fallback chain + lossless `raw_payload` cover a miss — re-verify on the first
prod pull): the per-column SOURCE field names/casing (`id`, `clientId`, `assessmentName`, `title`,
`category`, `priority`, `status`, `targetDate`).
