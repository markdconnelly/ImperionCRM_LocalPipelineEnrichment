# Imperion CRM — cross-repo production-readiness plan

> **You are in: `ImperionCRM_LocalPipelineEnrichment` — synced copy.** Canonical: `ImperionCRM/docs/architecture/production-readiness-plan.md`.
> Update the canonical and re-sync. **As of 2026-06-10 (post build-sprint).** This repo's section is marked **← this repo** below.

## TL;DR

**The code backlog is done (2026-06-10).** In one cross-repo sprint, every code item from
the previous plan landed, merged, and deployed — plus the AI Board:

1. **Agent platform user-facing:** the Agents operations page (ADR-0048) and the **AI Board
   of Directors** (schema 0056/ADR-0049 · backend runtime ADR-0039 · the `/board` module)
   are live. The Board was the last placeholder module — **no placeholders remain.**
2. **Per-user OAuth is built end to end** (backend ADR-0038 ↔ web callback route + Settings
   wiring): start → provider consent → token to Key Vault → refresh-on-read → revoke.
   Activation is per-provider operator config (app registrations).
3. **Both pipelines write everything they collect:** cloud webhooks land Autotask tickets
   bronze→silver in near-real-time with hash parity against the bulk loader (pipeline
   ADR-0013); the local module (v0.5.0) has post writers for all granted bronze tables and
   gold composers for **nine** entity types.
4. **Migrations `0001–0058` applied to prod** (verified). Grants follow the code: 0055
   (pipeline writes), 0056 (agent core, backend-writes/web-reads), 0057 (composer reads),
   0058 (project types as data + project/task columns, front-end ADR-0052 — app-owned;
   no new local-pipeline grants).

What remains is **operator configuration** (§ checklist below) and a short tail of
**deferred builds** (ingestion engines, lead-capture receivers, enrichment endpoints,
Sentinel/KQM/DocuSign collectors, M365 comms bronze tables).

## The four planes (status snapshot)

| Repo | Role | State (2026-06-10) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`ImperionCRM`** (front-end) | GUI; direct DB reads; **owns DB schema + migrations** | Live. Migrations `0001–0058` applied. Agents page (ADR-0048), Board module (ADR-0049), project board (ADR-0052 #95), OAuth UI + callback route, saved views, device inventory all real. |
| **`ImperionCRM_Backend`** | ALL processes: agent runtime, OAuth, sends, credentials, semantic search | Claude tool-use orchestrator (ADR-0036) + tier presets/budget (ADR-0037) + per-user OAuth (ADR-0038) + **Board runtime** (ADR-0039) deployed. Sends gated on consent; SMS awaits ACS config. |
| **`ImperionCRM_Pipeline`** (cloud) | Live data: webhooks, bronze→silver merge, on-demand refresh | Webhook payload handlers **implemented** (ADR-0013): Autotask tickets land + merge inline; Graph notifications trigger GDAP-fail-closed targeted refresh. Merge covers contacts/accounts/devices/contracts/tickets/exposures/assessments. |
| **`ImperionCRM_LocalPipelineEnrichment`** (on-prem) ← *this repo* | Heavy lifting: bulk ingestion + **all** vectorization | Module **v0.5.0**: post writers fanned out (PR #68), **nine** knowledge composers (PR #69 — account, contact, contract, ticket, device, exposure, assessment, proposal, posture), 279 hermetic tests. Vectorization stage built; awaits the real Voyage key. |

## Operator checklist (the remaining unblocks, in order of payoff)

1. **Voyage key** — replace the placeholder in Key Vault `Voyage-Embedding-API-Key`, then
   `Invoke-ImperionKnowledgeSync -Vectorize` (module v0.5.0 staged; grants 0056/0057 live).
   → semantic search + agent retrieval go live over the full gold layer.
2. **Knowledge re-sync** — `Invoke-ImperionKnowledgeSync` (interim mode) to add the five
   new entity types to gold (devices, proposals, exposures, assessments, posture).
3. **Per-user OAuth providers** — per backend ADR-0038: `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL`
   (`https://imperioncrm.azurewebsites.net/api/connections`), per-provider app
   registrations + `OAUTH_<P>_CLIENT_ID` / `OAUTH_<P>_CLIENT_SECRET_SECRET`, and the
   backend MI's **Key Vault Secrets Officer** role (token + state secret writes).
4. **ACS connection string** → Key Vault (`ACS_CONNECTION_SECRET`) for live SMS sends.
5. **GDAP partner app** registration (Partner Center) → un-501s the GDAP consent flow.
6. **Pipeline app setting `PARTNER_TENANT_ID`** — the ticket webhook answers 503 until set.
7. **Secret rotation before go-live** — follow the new
   secrets-rotation runbook (front-end `docs/operations/secrets-rotation-runbook.md`).
8. **On-prem host provisioning** — service identity + machine cert + SecretStore
   (`docs/deployment/unattended-bringup.md` in the local repo); ends interim mode.

## Per-repo change lists

### `ImperionCRM` (front-end)
- [x] ~~Apply legacy-vector-drop + 0047–0057~~ — all applied and verified in prod.
- [x] ~~Un-stub the AI Agents / Board pages~~ — both real (ADR-0048, ADR-0049).
- [x] ~~OAuth connect/disconnect + callback route~~ — wired to backend ADR-0038.
- [ ] **Rotate the deferred secrets** before go-live — runbook now exists (operator).
- [ ] Ongoing: move remaining *processing* server actions behind backend APIs as they
      gain real processing (sends UI → approval queue; campaign launches).

### `ImperionCRM_Backend`
- [x] ~~Real Claude tool-use orchestrator loop~~ (ADR-0036) + presets/budget (ADR-0037).
- [x] ~~Per-user OAuth flows~~ (ADR-0038) — token custody in Key Vault, refresh-on-read.
- [x] ~~AI Board runtime~~ (ADR-0039) — convene → 2-round deliberation → synthesis,
      budget-gated, fully audited (`agent_run` + `board_*`).
- [ ] **Operator:** OAuth provider registrations · KV Secrets Officer for the MI · ACS
      connection string · GDAP partner app (§ checklist 3–5).
- [ ] **Deferred builds:** ingestion engines (Graph email/Teams, Plaud, social) ·
      lead-capture receivers · LLM enrichment endpoints (`contact_enrichment`,
      pre-discovery draft answers).

### `ImperionCRM_Pipeline` (cloud)
- [x] ~~merge-sources for contracts/tickets/exposures/assessments~~ (+ on-demand merge).
- [x] ~~Webhook payload handlers~~ (ADR-0013) — Autotask tickets inline land+merge with
      bulk-loader hash parity; Graph notifications → GDAP-checked targeted refresh.
- [ ] **Operator:** set `PARTNER_TENANT_ID`; verify live Autotask payload shapes + hash
      parity on the first real ticket (watch the bulk reconcile's `unchanged` tally).
- [ ] **Build:** Graph **subscription creation/renewal timer** (notifications can't flow
      until subscriptions exist). Security-posture stays out of cloud merge — it reaches
      the agent via the local posture composer (gold), by design.

### `ImperionCRM_LocalPipelineEnrichment` (on-prem) ← *this repo*
- [x] ~~Vectorization stage~~ (ADR-0009) · ~~bronze post fan-out~~ (PR #68) ·
      ~~nine knowledge composers~~ (PR #69, v0.5.0).
- [ ] **Operator:** real Voyage key → `-Vectorize`; knowledge re-sync; host provisioning
      (§ checklist 1/2/8).
- [ ] **Build:** Sentinel collector · KQM + DocuSign collectors (bronze tables exist) ·
      M365 mail/Teams bronze tables (front-end migration first) → their post writers.

## Recommended sequence

1. **Checklist 1–2** (Voyage key + re-sync) → *the agent reasons over the full estate.*
2. **Checklist 3** (one OAuth provider — start with m365) → *personal connections live.*
3. **Checklist 4–6** → *SMS, GDAP consent, real-time tickets.*
4. **Checklist 7–8** (rotation + host) → *go-live posture; unattended schedule takes over.*
5. Then the deferred builds, highest-value first: Graph subscription timer → ingestion
   engines → enrichment endpoints → remaining collectors.

## Verified live in prod (2026-06-10)

- Migrations `0001–0058`; agent core + board tables with 5 seeded personas; saved views;
  device inventory; agent settings singleton.
- Deploy pipelines green on all three Azure repos (web app + 2 Function Apps, OIDC).
- Gold layer: 205 knowledge objects (4 entity types) — composers for 9 ready to re-sync.
- 8 PRs merged this sprint: front-end #76/#77/#78(+#79)/#80/#81/#82 · backend #15/#16 ·
  pipeline #16 · local #68/#69.
